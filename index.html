        <h3>Ganja Shaman</h3>

        <p>
          Cannabis is a plant just like any other on planet Earth. It grows in a wide array of strains, varieties, and types. Much like choosing between red delicious, gala or granny smith apples at the grocery store, there are a ton of medical marijuana options available to choose from. 
        </p>


        <p>Cannabis affects everyone differently. The same strain might alleviate one person’s PTSD while it helps another person’s digestive issues. In the same fashion, certain cannabis strains could help a person’s migraines while a different strain doesn’t help at all.
        </p>

        <p>Our Med Cabinet aka, an algorithmic collection on data on over 1,900 different cannabis strains, can help you best decipher which strains can facilitate healing for your specific symptoms.

            <h3> Topicals </h3>

            <p>
              Topicals are utilized for fast-acting localized relief of inflammation and pain. Cannabis topicals are typically non-intoxicating, which allows patients to enjoy the plant’s therapeutic effects without THC’s attendant psychoactivity. This growing category of cannabis treatments has expanded to include transdermal solutions, as well as lubricants, often including essential oils such as clove and wintergreen for additional relief.

            <h3> Edibles </h3>

            <p>
              The term edibles refers to any foods, candies, baked goods, or drinks that contain cannabis in some form that can be ingested, rather than smoked or vaporized. Edibles are often in the form of baked goods and sweets like cookies, candies, chocolate bars, or brownies.

              Some people prefer their cannabis in an edible form because they don’t like inhaling the smoke and the resin that results from smoking joints. Edibles are also a popular way to administer medical marijuana in patients, particularly the elderly and children.

            <h3> OG Smokables </h3>

            <p>
              Prefer a more traditional consumption method? Although many methods are available for consuming medical cannabis, smoking continues to rank among the most popular. Cannabis is fast acting when inhaled, providing an efficient path to the relief of severe symptoms. Smoking allows patients to carefully control their dose by taking multiple small inhalations until the desired level of symptom relief is achieved. Finally, smoking is a simple way of sampling a variety of medical cannabis strains in order to discover their unique effects.
